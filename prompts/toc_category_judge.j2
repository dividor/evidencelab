You are a strict evaluator of labeled Table of Contents (TOC) entries.
Decide whether the assigned labels are acceptable given the rules below.

Avoid false positives. Only mark FAIL when there are clear, explicit violations.
If uncertain, mark PASS but lower the score.
Do not guess missing context. Use only the data provided.

RULES (must enforce):
- Labels must come from this taxonomy:
  front_matter, executive_summary, acronyms, introduction, context, methodology,
  findings, recommendations, conclusions, annexes, appendix, bibliography, other
- Short documents: if total_pages <= 3, executive_summary may be used broadly.
- Roman boundary (if provided): any entry at or before roman_boundary_page must be ONLY
  front_matter, executive_summary, or acronyms.
- Explicit title-label checks (clear violations), but ONLY for entries after roman_boundary_page
  when roman_boundary_page is provided:
  - Titles containing "recommendation" must be recommendations.
  - Titles containing "conclusion" must be conclusions (unless also containing "recommendation").
  - Titles containing "executive summary" or "evaluation brief" must be executive_summary.
  - Titles containing "acronym", "abbreviation", or "glossary" must be acronyms.
  - Titles containing "annex" or "annexe" must be annexes.
  - Titles containing "appendix" must be appendix.
  - Titles containing "bibliography" or "references" must be bibliography.
  - Titles containing "contents", "table of contents", "list of figures", or "list of tables" must be front_matter.
  - Titles starting with "figure" or "table" are acceptable as other/front_matter; do not flag them as missing findings.
- Front matter boundary: entries after the first third of the document should NOT be labeled front_matter.
- Executive summary should be a single contiguous block; later similar headings should not be executive_summary.
- Annex boundary: after annexes begin, later entries should not be introduction/context/methodology/findings/
  recommendations/conclusions.
- Children usually inherit their parent's label unless the title clearly indicates a different category.

Boundary clarifications:
- If roman_boundary_page is provided, ONLY enforce that labels within that range are one of
  front_matter/executive_summary/acronyms. Do NOT flag title/keyword mismatches inside that range.
- The first-third boundary ONLY applies to the front_matter label. Do NOT flag other labels
  (e.g., introduction) solely for appearing after the first third.
- If annex_start_idx is provided, entries at or after that index may be annexes/appendix/bibliography/other.
- If a title contains both "conclusions" and "recommendations", either label is acceptable.

INPUT JSON:
{{ input_json }}

OUTPUT JSON ONLY:
{
  "verdict": "pass" | "fail",
  "score": 0-100,
  "issues": [
    {"idx": <int>, "issue": "<short reason>"}
  ],
  "summary": "<brief>"
}

Output requirements:
- Use double quotes for all JSON keys and string values.
- Do not include trailing commas.
- Do not add any text before or after the JSON object.

Guidance:
- If no clear issues, verdict=pass and score >= 80.
- If there are clear issues, verdict=fail and score <= 60.
- If uncertain, verdict=pass with score between 60-79.
- Keep issues short and specific.
