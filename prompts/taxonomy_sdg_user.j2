## Taxonomy Values to Evaluate

**IMPORTANT INSTRUCTION**: For EACH value below, scan the document summary for the keywords listed in "Evaluation Criteria". If you find ANY of those keywords in the summary, you MUST include that value in your response.

Note: The document may address multiple topics concurrently. Evaluate each value independently.

{% for code, details in values.items() %}
### {{ code }} - {{ details.name }}

**Definition:** {{ details.definition }}

**Evaluation Criteria:** {{ details.llm_prompt }}

{% endfor %}

## Task
Carefully review the document summary above and the taxonomy values below. Return a JSON list of ALL taxonomy values that apply, with reasons for each match.

**Matching Criteria** - Include a taxonomy value if ANY of the following apply:
1. **Explicit mention**: The goal name or code appears in the text (e.g., "SDG 5", "Gender Equality")
2. **Keyword presence**: Keywords from the "Evaluation Criteria" appear in the summary (e.g., document mentions "climate change" → include SDG 13)
3. **Thematic alignment**: The document's activities or objectives advance the goal (e.g., "women's empowerment programs" → include SDG 5)

**Process**: For each taxonomy value listed below:
- Scan the summary for the keywords listed in its "Evaluation Criteria"
- Check if the document's themes align with the goal's definition
- If either match, INCLUDE it in your response with a specific reason

Be thorough - development documents typically address 3-7 SDGs.
