The user asked: "{{ query }}"

Here are the search results with their full text. You MUST use ONLY the information from these results, and ONLY the information that is relevant to the question:

{% for result in results[:5] %}
[{{ loop.index }}] {{ result.title }} ({{ result.organization }}{% if result.year %}, {{ result.year }}{% endif %})
Full Text: {{ result.text }}

{% endfor %}

IMPORTANT:
- Answer ONLY their specific question: "{{ query }}"
- Use ONLY information explicitly stated in the result texts above
- Do NOT add external knowledge or make inferences
- Do NOT provide general summaries unless specifically asked
- Use inline citations [1], [2], [3], [4], [5] after EVERY factual claim to show which result it came from
- You can use multiple citations like [1, 3] if information appears in multiple results
- Try to cite ALL relevant results (don't skip numbers like going from [1] to [3])
- If the results don't fully answer the question, acknowledge what's missing
