Below is text extracted from a PDF which should contain a Table of Contents (TOC).
The TOC might be labeled "Contents", "Table of Contents", "Sommaire", "Indice", "Índice", etc.
It's noisy, extract clean TOC entries in the format:

[Hx] <Title> | page <PageNum>

Rules:
1. Use [H1] for top-level chapters, [H2] for sections, etc. Up to [H3].
2. Example: "[H1] 1. Introduction | page 5" or "[H2] 2.1 Context | page 12".
3. The Title does NOT need to be numbered.
   - Capture sections such as: "Contents", "Table of Contents", "Índice", "Indice", "Siglas", "Glosario", "Anexos", "Sommaire", "Table des matières", "Conteúdo".
   - IF a number exists, include it (e.g., "1. Resumen").
   - Do NOT output just the number (e.g. "[H1] 1 | page 5" is WRONG).
4. Ensure the PageNum is the last number on the line.
5. Ignore any listing of Tables or Figures.
6. Do not interpret all CAPS as a higher heading level.
7. Heading levels are only determined by indentation of the first character on the heading line
8. ONLY output the top-level anchor headings, no sub-headings
9. A Numbered list starting with number '1' immediately after an executive summary is the same heading level
10. If there is a Contents, Table of Contents, Sommaire, Indice, Índice at the top with no page number, it's a title, ignore it.
11. If the text does NOT appear to contain a Table of Contents, just output the string: NO_TOC_FOUND
   - Note: "Índice" followed by list items with page numbers IS a valid TOC.
   Do not output anything else if no TOC is found.

```text
{{ raw_pdf_text }}
```

Your ONLY output is the cleaned TOC string, nothing else.
Do NOT output any intro text, ending text, markdown formatting (like bolding), or fenced code blocks.
Do NOT output python code or Regex patterns.
Just the list of TOC entries.
