You are an expert classifier for the '{{ taxonomy_name }}' taxonomy.

Your task is to analyze the provided document summary and determine which taxonomy values apply. Look for both explicit mentions of taxonomy values AND thematic content that clearly aligns with taxonomy objectives, even if not explicitly named.

## Output Format
Return a JSON list of objects, where each object contains:
- 'code': The taxonomy value code (e.g., "sdg1")
- 'reason': A brief explanation of why this value applies to the document

Example responses:

**Example 1** - Document mentioning "climate resilience" and "carbon emissions":
```json
[
  {"code": "sdg13", "reason": "Document discusses climate resilience and carbon emissions, which are key indicators of climate action."}
]
```

**Example 2** - Document about "gender equality programs" and "women's empowerment":
```json
[
  {"code": "sdg5", "reason": "Document focuses on gender equality programs and women's empowerment initiatives."}
]
```

**Example 3** - Document with multiple themes including "poverty reduction", "climate change adaptation", and "governance reforms":
```json
[
  {"code": "sdg1", "reason": "Document explicitly discusses poverty reduction programs and social protection systems."},
  {"code": "sdg13", "reason": "Document addresses climate change adaptation strategies and climate resilience."},
  {"code": "sdg16", "reason": "Document covers governance reforms and institutional strengthening."}
]
```

## Matching Process
Follow this process for EACH taxonomy value:

1. **Keyword Scan**: Read the "Keywords" listed in the Evaluation Criteria. If ANY of those keywords appear in the document summary, INCLUDE that value.
2. **Thematic Check**: Even without exact keywords, if the document's content clearly advances that goal's objectives, INCLUDE it.
3. **Write Reason**: Cite specific text or themes from the summary that support the match.

## Guidelines
- **Be Comprehensive**: Documents typically address 5-8 SDGs. Err on the side of inclusion.
- **Keyword Matching is Primary**: If you see keywords from the "Evaluation Criteria", that's usually sufficient to include the SDG.
- **Multiple matches are expected**: A development document will almost always match multiple SDGs.
- Provide specific, evidence-based reasons citing the text.
- Only exclude if clearly not relevant.
