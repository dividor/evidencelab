For instance, the Department of Energy (DoE) faces its issues due to limited staff and relies heavily on Project Management Unit (PMU) to aid them. The work required is at implementation level and the ownership seemed missing in that aspect. Bilateral agreements with friendly countries alongside help provided by ADB, WB and other such donor agencies goes to show that the energy program is donor driven. This goes to show that the government is yet to take full ownership of the program, and due to the dependency, it is unable to determine the alignment. While the help is much appreciated, the needs of both the public and private sector must be focused instead of just the demands of the donor program, and those demands should be in line with the master plan. Government of Tuvalu should be the pilot behind all such projects instead of the donor agencies to ensure success.",

The project design  referred  to  the  Tuvalu  National  Gender  Policy,  including  the  Strategic  Action  Plan 2014-2016 that focused on four key policy measures: Institutional strengthening and capacity building, Women's economic empowerment, Women in decision-making, and Ending violence against women as a result of the Stock Taking and analysis in 2013.\n\nIn the design work, the PPG Team has referred to available gender analysis at the national level gender studies and assessments, e.g., Stock take of the  Gender Mainstreaming Capacity of Pacific  Island  Governments  -  Tuvalu  (SPC  2013)  and  the  Tuvalu  National  Gender  Policy (2014-2016). On this basis, the Logical Framework of the project included gender indicators, e.g.,  number  of  women  actively  involved  in  the  planning  and  implementation  of  energy services provision in the outer islands, to make sure that the project attends to relevant gender issues at least at the Outcome level. The indicator/target can be expounded during the Inception phase when stakeholders meet and plan details since gender planning requirements need to be taken alongside other overarching national objectives contained in the National Gender Policy and Action Plan as mentioned above.\n\nTo reach the overarching goal of gender equality and empowerment of women, an important contribution should be application of RE/EE technologies in community-based projects. The FASNETT project  design  includes  updating  of  relevant  gender  mainstreaming  policy  and guidelines in the project action plans and strategies during implementation.\n\nThe project document presents opportunities for involvement of women in both management and technical departments of the Tuvaluan Government and in implementation of the project. This was expected to be reached with gender-sensitive policies in the energy sector and the energy end-use, e.g., women's participation in projects that promote or enhance women-owned and  women-operated  businesses  that  make  use  of  RE-based  energy  or  energy  efficient appliances.

        "snippet": "Financial hardship and recurrent crises challenge the PA's long-term financial sustainability of the PA. One result is that donor support risks becoming an open-ended endeavour. [^43] There is considerable fragmentation in recovery, rehabilitation and development response in oPt. In general, development partners agree that aid coordination in Palestine is challenging. [^44]   Fragmented aid coordination has hampered an already challenging development context; sustained aid dependency effectively makes international agency interventions restrictive.\n\nMost international support actors, including UNDP, do not incorporate specific exit strategies to mitigate the decline of ODA in oPt into their approaches. The Local Aid Coordination Secretariat (LACS) mechanism has not been effective. As a result, potential competition between government actors and CSOs (or even donors) risks being reinforced by international aid that redirects staff resources and attention away from wider reform priorities. According to observers, this is a real concern as no lead evaluation of aid effectiveness in oPt has been conducted. After the abolishment of the Ministry of Planning in 2015, planning functions became less effective. Further, government ministers became less accountable for resource allocations and the use of international support.\n\nUNDP recovery, rehabilitation and development support are relevant to the oPt context, a context in which international programming funding is predominantly for short-term and humanitarian support, whereas there is bilateral engagement by donors and international financial institutions for sector reforms and governance. Such contextual constraints call for well-conceptualized and comprehensive solutions alongside recurrent humanitarian responses, with purposeful partnerships.\n\nFinding 2. UNDP has played a significant role in the development trajectory of oPt since the establishment of the PA. In a restrictive occupation context, UNDP contributions to recurrent recovery and reconstruction in oPt have been significant. UNDP programmes were responsive to key national and people priorities. with decades of development and humanitarian support to oPt, UNDP had the leverage to form strong partnerships with the PA and other actors.\n\n[^43]: Historically, the revenues of the PNA have been dependent on two sources: clearance revenues and international aid . Estimated at $2.4 billion annually (15 percent of GDP), clearance revenues constitute the backbone of the PA budget and account for 66 percent of total PA revenues and over half of its expenditure. However, repeated Israeli interruption of the clearance revenue have exacerbated the chronic PNA financial crisis (driven by outdated clearance mechanisms of Palestinian imports through Israel; excessive administrative fees levied to clear those imports; unfair distribution of revenue from exit fees paid by Palestinian passengers exiting the oPt; the withholding, by Israel, of deductions from wages of Palestinians working in Israel and the settlements, in particular the equalization levy, the health stamp, social security and the pension funds; indirect imports, and public revenue from Area C). Fiscal leakage from the revenue flows that the Palestinian treasury should be able to collect from indirect taxes imposed on Palestinian imports. In a study published in 2019, UNCTAD estimated the total value of fiscal leakage resulting from six main sources at $473.4 million in 2015, which represented about 3.7 percent of the Palestinian GDP or 17.8 percent of total Palestinian tax revenues that year. Moreover, international aid decreased from $1.2 billion in 2010 (62 percent of total revenues) to $464 million in 2020 (12 percent of total revenues). In the justice sector, for example, international aid declined by 50 percent in the last few years.

        "snippet": "Despite a protracted humanitarian context, the nexus approach is not evident in oPt. while agencies recognize the importance of the humanitarian and development nexus as well as the peacebuilding dimension, concrete approaches are lacking. UNDP programmes are not an exception to this trend. The UNSCDF by itself is not enabling nexus collaborations.\n\nA larger issue is the weak aid coordination in oPt. Fragmented international cooperation is a factor that limits nexus programming, which, to a certain extent, constrained strategic partnerships.\n\nConclusion 3. Occupation and other contextual limitations notwithstanding, UNDP was successful in contributing to the NDP agenda in the areas of access to justice, gender justice processes, e-governance and local elections, which have the potential for longer-term outcomes. Sustained collaborative efforts in the justice and the local government areas are essential to linking UNDP pilots and innovations with reform targets and for synergies and complementarities with other donor interventions.\n\nDuring the current PPF, UNDP support continued a transition from infrastructure and humanitarian assistance towards more support-to-governance processes and institutional development. Local elections were successfully conducted; UNDP contributions to this are notable. The joint Sawasya programme illustrates the benefits of a more comprehensive reform approach, which is based on partnerships with other UN agencies and key donors in governance strengthening. E-governance innovation like Mizan within the judiciary and social media awareness campaigns are significant initiatives with the potential for longer-term outcomes. UNDP facilitation, while modest, reiterates the importance of protecting CSOs and supporting their complementary role in advocacy and service delivery to counterbalance the impacts of the occupation and the democratic deficit in oPt.",

The Facility in Myanmar was very active and had developed a range of knowledge products in partnership with the Ministry of Planning and Finance and the social sector ministries (Education, Health, and Social Welfare, Relief and Resettlement) prior to the military takeover in February 2021. As part of the budget analysis, the Facility supported the development of an internal database for line ministries to track their expenditures, which was greatly appreciated by Myanmar government partners.

The Facility demonstrated its contribution towards advancing children's rights by optimizing the use of public budgets in the social sectors. Achievements were realized through evidence-building and knowledge products, catalysing budget and policy advocacy and engaging diverse stakeholders and partners.  The Facility fostered a conducive public finance environment amid the global COVID-19 pandemic and the socioeconomic challenges in the Lao PDR, Pakistan and Sri Lanka and amid the political and economic turmoil in Myanmar. However, the Facility's impact on improving the adequacy, effectiveness and efficiency of social sector spending for children's rights and development was somewhat limited by external and systemic constraints. Overall, the initial objectives were achieved, although the level of achievement varied across countries.\n\nThe Facility's actions at the regional and country levels aligned with a global normative framework, the UNICEF Strategic Plan (2016-2021 and 2022-2025), the SDGs, article 4 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child, the Public Finance for Children Framework, the European Union's efforts to strengthen PFM systems and the aid effectiveness agenda. Adaptability and flexibility were possible at the country level to plan and provide practical solutions to public finance bottlenecks in the social sectors, based on the recommendations of the ROM review. In Myanmar, the Facility adeptly adjusted its approach to continue contributing valuable public finance knowledge in a humanitarian context, and documentation of public finance support in humanitarian contexts could be used to generate lessons for other countries to learn from.\n\nCriterion Whom Level Importance\nRights UNICEF Country Office Medium\nGender",

Relevant challenges remained for long-term partnerships, including local ownership considering the unpredictability of financing, administrative barriers for access, and lack of quality institu -tional tools for knowledge management and capacity development.\n\nTo  improve  the  sustainability  of  its  interventions,  UN Women  supported  organizational  strengthening  initiatives to increase the knowledge and institutional capacity of  partners,  especially  those  receiving  small  grants.  This strategy  was  complemented  by  UN  Women's  technical support  to  partners  through  training  and  knowledge production and dissemination, which contributed to promoting local appropriation and evidence-based advocacy.  UN  Women  also  created  solutions  to  facilitate  its reach with CSOs and support the sustainability of interventions among implementing partners. This was evidenced by 'umbrella' and alliance models [^79] that allowed smaller CSOs to associate with larger and more established organizations with whom UN Women partnered, including in Colombia, Honduras and Brazil.

Women's  and  feminist  CSOs engage in a range of mission-driven actions such as monitoring policies, fostering political participation, delivering services and advocating for transformative social change. Despite their central role in addressing societal inequities, civil society's space to defend women's rights in the region has faced constraints with regressions in human rights.\n\nUN  Women's  2022-2025  Strategic  Plan  underscores  the imperative of deepening its civil society partnerships.

The introduction of the small grant modality was recognized for having provided added flexibility for UN Women offices to  create  partnerships  with  smaller,  local  organizations, and  for  supporting  institutional  capacity  strengthening. These grants were utilized flexibly to improve UN Women's responsiveness to CSO demands, including in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nUN  Women's  partnership  frameworks  with  civil  society followed  a  risk  management  approach  set  out  through the administrative requirements. However, feedback from both internal and external stakeholders was almost unanimous  in  highlighting  the  cumbersome  and  inefficient nature of the processes and procedures for partnerships. This  hindered  the  timely  execution  of  work  with  CSOs and  required  most  efforts  to  be  concentrated  on  initiating, managing and reporting rather than implementing activities. This indicates a need for UN Women to further streamline its processes in this area for a more responsive, agile and efficient organization.\n\nRelated findings: 11-12",

        "snippet": "UN Women effectively reached the CSO representatives of priority groups facing greater discrimination and vulnerability through agreements and other forms of engagement. There was a clear opportunity across the regional portfolio to scale support to other groups that had comparatively limited coverage. Capacity-building initiatives had systemic challenges in terms of their effectiveness.\n\nUN Women's collaboration with civil society in the region clearly emphasized a robust focus on priority groups and strategies aimed at addressing the fundamental causes of inequality, all while applying a human rights perspective that  aligns  with  the  United  Nations  principle  of  leaving no one behind. Most agreements with civil society were directed at groups experiencing heightened vulnerability  and discrimination, often with a focus on survivors of gender-based violence. Through a combination of partnership approaches, UN Women also managed to engage with grassroots organizations to a certain extent.\n\nHowever, there were institutional challenges that constrained  the  Entity's  capacity  to  extend  its  reach  to certain populations, including those facing multiple vulnerabilities through an intersectional lens. Youth organizations represented an estimated 16 per cent of formal partnerships,  but  still  faced  challenges  in  accessing  UN Women's partnerships given institutional barriers. In this regard, there is a clear opportunity to enhance the conceptualization  and  approach  of  many  programmes  and partnerships  by  incorporating  more  comprehensive  data and design, particularly in offices where the emphasis on target groups was less pronounced.",

        "snippet": "UN Women used engagement modalities for its partnerships with civil society organizations in a complementary manner across its integrated triple mandate to achieve policy results, agenda-setting and network-building.\n\nCSOs  comprised  the  highest  number  of  formal  partnerships  with  UN Women in  the  region  compared  to  other stakeholder groups. The deployment of  complementary  engagement  modalities  for  partnering  with  CSOs allowed  UN Women  to  achieve  long-term  results  across its  triple mandate. First, programmatic partnerships with CSOs  supported  legislation,  protocols  and  policy  frameworks in the region that contributed to relevant normative gains  through  CSO  partner  engagement  in  multi-stakeholder dialogue. In contexts of disaster and humanitarian crises, technical and financial support with a focus on the protection  of  human-rights  defenders  was  responsible for preventing and responding to gender-based violence; providing emergency income and entrepreneurship training to build the autonomy of women; and the insertion  of  gender  perspectives  in  peacebuilding  processes. UN  Women  facilitated  the  advancement  of  women's rights and autonomy together with CSOs in work related to women's engagement in peacebuilding and feminicide.\n\nSecond,  UN Women's  facilitation  of  participatory  spaces amplified  women's  voices  and  CSO  participation  both through  traditional  political  and  ad  hoc  mechanisms. The  elevation  of  indigenous  women's  rights  and  parity democracy stood out. This strategy enhanced civil society leading's  role  in  relevant  decision-making  spaces  and created  opportunities  for  the  insertion  of  gender,  ethnic and  race  perspectives  in  political  processes.  UN Women promoted  women's  leadership  in the  long-term  and enabled  the  achievement of sustainable results  through the  configuration  of  civil  society  networks  on  strategic agendas.",

While the project laid a strong foundation for promoting social cohesion and youth empowerment, its long-term sustainability hinges on addressing these limitations and ensuring the continued engagement of national partners, particularly NYSC, in carrying forward the project's legacy.\n\nRecommendations of the evaluation focus on the following:\n\n1. Develop comprehensive risk assessments and contingency plans to anticipate potential disruptions and enhance project adaptability.\n\n2. Future projects should implement a more rigorous vetting process for selecting service providers, prioritizing experience, capacity, and ethical conduct.\n\n3. Ensure broader participation and flexibility, explore and pilot a more geographically decentralized or hybrid training approach.\n\n4. UN agencies should establish and communicate to stakeholders a clear project coordination framework with well-defined roles and responsibilities for all stakeholders, complemented by robust communication protocols and centralized platforms for information sharing.\n\n5. Strengthening M&E frameworks to incorporate both quantitative and qualitative indicators, including long-term outcomes and disaggregated data, is crucial for capturing the project's full impact.\n\n6. Integrating a comprehensive gender equality strategy, actively addressing societal barriers and promoting women's leadership, is essential for achieving meaningful and sustainable gender equality.\n\n7. Future projects should prioritize allocating increased funding and time for youth-led community projects to enhance their scope, impact, and sustainability.\n\n8. Future projects should consider fostering a multi-faceted approach to community engagement, leveraging trainer expertise for mentorship together with CSO support\n\n9.
