Heatmapper is a quick way to analyze lots of documents to see trends in document tags and types as part of evidence research. It generates a grid showing search results for combinations of document attributes you provide, allowing you to see where there are gaps as well as peaks in activity.

Another way to think of it is as a grid search.

For example, you can view:

- The number of documents **X** their type published each year
- The number of documents with AI-generated **X** publishing organization
- The number of search hits **X** queries you provide by year

.. and more!

You can get granular, filtering searches down the individual documents and queries. You can also drill down into the underlying content to view individual documents and paragraphs as well as export to Excel for further offline analysis.
