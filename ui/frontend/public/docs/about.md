# About Evidence Lab

Evidence lab is a free open source prototyping platform that provides a document pipeline, search, and AI-powered information discovery tools. The aim is to provide a quick start for those looking to use AI with their documents and a place where new ideas can be tested.

You can run the code yourself, or explore the online version at [evidencelab.ai](https://evidencelab.ai) which has so far been populated with 20,000 United Nations humanitarian evaluation reports sourced from the [United Nations Evaluation Group](https://www.un.org/evaluations) and 8,000 reports related to Fraud and Program Integrity as sourced from [The World Bank](https://www.worldbank.org/ext/en/home). See [Data](/data) for more information on these amazing documents.

If you would like to have your public documents added to Evidence Lab, or would like to contribute to the project, please reach out to [evidence-lab@astrobagel.com](mailto:evidence-lab@astrobagel.com).

## Philosophy

Evidence lab was developed out of research work for the blog, so core principles are ...

* **The full pipeline can run on a desktop computer and process 20,000 30-page documents in a week for less than $50.**
* **The pipeline and user interface should be easily configured for use with any folder of documents**
* **Should support quick/cheap parsing to start, with ability to activate more complex components later on without having to reprocess everything**
* **The platform can run with open as well as proprietary models**
* **The environment should have tools for easily monitoring processing as well as exploring AI information retrieval**

Some lofty, often conflicting, goals! Always a work in progress, and low-cost high-speed processing which runs on a desktop computer, does come with a few shortcuts. To run on a modest server, the user interface might not be the fastest out there, and in not using expensive LLMs for parsing (only cheap ones!), the ingestion had to be tuned to the document data styles. That said, the design has tried to allow for future improvements.
